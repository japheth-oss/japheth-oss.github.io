                <div class="schools-list">
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Thomism</strong> - Based on St. Thomas Aquinas, emphasizes the real distinction between essence and existence,
                        the priority of intellect over will, the analogy of being, and intrinsic efficacy of grace.
                    </div>
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Scotism</strong> - Based on Blessed John Duns Scotus, emphasizes univocity of being, the priority of will over intellect,
                        the formal distinction, and the theological necessity of the Immaculate Conception.
                    </div>
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Augustinianism</strong> - Based on St. Augustine, emphasizes the corruption of the will by original sin,
                        the necessity of irresistible grace, predestination not based on foreseen merits, and divine illumination.
                    </div>
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Molinism</strong> - Based on Luis de Molina, emphasizes middle knowledge (scientia media),
                        libertarian free will, and predestination based on foreknowledge rather than prior decrees.
                    </div>
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Banezianism</strong> - Dominican school emphasizing physical premotion, predestination prior to foreknowledge,
                        and grace efficacious by God's action rather than human cooperation.
                    </div>
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Bonaventurianism</strong> - Based on St. Bonaventure, emphasizes divine illumination, Platonic metaphysics,
                        the inseparability of intellectual and affective knowledge, and the Franciscan spiritual tradition.
                    </div>
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Suarezianism</strong> - Based on Francisco Suárez, emphasizes conceptual (not real) distinction between essence and existence,
                        rejection of physical premotion, and synthesis of various scholastic traditions.
                    </div>
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Nominalism</strong> - Based on William of Ockham, emphasizes that universals are merely mental constructs,
                        God's will as the foundation of morality, and the separation of faith and reason.
                    </div>
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Lullism</strong> - Based on Ramon Llull, emphasizes a universal logical-combinatorial method for evangelization,
                        demonstration of theological truths through rational diagrams, and systematic combination of divine attributes.
                    </div>
                    <div class="school-item">
                        <strong>Latin Averroism</strong> - Emphasizes the autonomy of philosophy from theology, the possibility of parallel truths,
                        and Aristotelian philosophy as the best description of the natural world, even if contrary to theology.
